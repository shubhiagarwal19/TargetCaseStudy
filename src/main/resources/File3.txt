How should you really avoid junk food?

According to Dr. Sharma, the red flags that you should look out for and avoid bringing home include trans-fats, refined grains, salt and high fructose corn syrup. Avoid foods that say corn sweetener, corn syrup, corn syrup solids, partially hydrogenated, fractionated, or hydrogenated on their label.
So next time you want to know if what's on your plate is junk or not, ask yourself these 3 crucial questions: 

1. How many calories am I consuming in this one serving? 
2. What are the healthy nutrients I am taking in with this meal? 
3. What's the quality of ingredients used; how fresh is this food item?

COMMENTSDo note that quitting junk food is a gradual process. If you are someone who is accustomed to daily doses of junk, then quitting may not be way. The first few days could be tough as you may experience some of these symptoms: irritability, headaches, dip in energy levels and so on. An occasional treat never hurts, what you have to look out against is consistent consumption of junk foods, especially at the cost of healthy nutrition.
